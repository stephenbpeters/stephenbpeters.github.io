# D3-Challenge
Data Analytics Bootcamp 2021 homework on JavaScript D3

This is homework for the 2021 Data Analytics Bootcamp.  This demo uses the D3 library in JavaScript to interpret and plot data related to healthcare in a web page.

To run the project you'll need to start a local web server in the directory the files live in.

This can be simply by running this command in the shell:

`python3 -m http.server`

Once the web server is running, you can view the project in your web browser by going here:

`http://localhost:8000/`
